# Common Utilities for Customizable Flogger Backends

This artifact provides base functionality for any of Flogger Next's logger backend implementations.
You should not need to depend on this directly unless you are implementing a new backend.

For normal users, you just need to depend on one of the system specific backends available, such
as [backend-system](../backend-system/README.md) or [backend-log4j](../backend-log4j/README.md).
